### Project Duration: 350 hrs

## About:
AOSSIE Scholar is a Chrome extension that calculates performance-based metrics for researchers from Google Scholar profiles. The extension needs improvements to UI and major backend updates. This year, a login/ signup system is needed to be introduced to maintain individual profiles. The UI for displaying computed matrices needs to be revamped. Typescript is to be introduced to make mathematical computations accurate and error-proof, along with button injection into the website to make the extension more accessible. The CI/CD to be re-developed for deployment. The extension needs to be re-deveoped to make it cross-browser compatible and deployed to extension stores. e2e, unit testings already present should be re-worked upon to meet the new requirements. Code coverage should be more than 90%.

## Deliverables:
- A fully functional extension.

## Required Skills:
- Research
- Python
- UX/UI design
- Django REST Framework
- React
- Testing and Loggings

## Mentors:
