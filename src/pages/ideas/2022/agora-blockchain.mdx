### Project Duration: 175 hrs

## About:
In GSoCâ€™21 we have implemented the first version of Blockchain based Agora web application, with basic features like user registration, election creation, voting and result calculation. This year we want to introduce more advanced features as followed:
1. Open and Invite based elections - This issue deals with working on implementing two types of elections. One is open-election, in which anyone can vote, provided they are KYC verified. And secondly, invite-based, in which organisers will send them email invites with a secure single-use link. Using that link a voter can vote without KYC verification.
2. Authentication and user KYC - This issue deals with the Authentication and user KYC, for genuine onboarding of users. Elections are very critical for an organization, and anyone with a wallet and few tokens in it should not be allowed to vote until they are KYC verified. There is also a second school of thought, which doesn't want to deal with all these authentication and KYC steps, and just want to vote. We have to think of a better way, in order to satisfy both.
3. Multiple algorithms to conduct elections - Adding more algorithms to vote to organize elections in our DApp. Currently, only the General voting algorithm is present in which voters can vote only to a single candidate representing their 1st preference. But there are certain algorithms like Oklahoma, in which voters can vote for more than 1 candidate according to their preferences. Similarly, there are many algorithms in the Agora library.
